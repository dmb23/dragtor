### Hooper’s Beta Ep. 46

Intro

The A2 is one of the most important pulleys in our hands. It’s what allows us to hold onto those tiny edges without the other parts of our finger essentially just coming apart. But how? It’s just a piece of tissue holding another tissue in place. And why is tearing your A2 the most ubiquitous injury in climbing?

In this mega video/manual we’re going to go in-depth into the A2 pulley. We will talk about anatomy, the causes of a tear and how to test yourself for it, the things you can do to treat it as well as ways of preventing it from happening in the first place and in the future, and the thing everyone wants to know: how soon can you get back to climbing.

Anatomy

The flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) runs from the proximal ¾’s of the medial and anterior surfaces of the ulna and interosseous membrane to the base of distal phalanges of the 2nd through 5th digits.

An injury to the A2 pulley could be as simple as a mild strain, or as advanced as a complete rupture of the pulley. In order to better understand and classify our injury, we will look at four main testing criteria and how they can help you identify the severity of your injury.

For observation, there are two main factors we will look at: swelling and bowstringing. Bowstringing occurs due to the flexor tendon now being pulled away from the bone. If your finger is extended, you won’t notice it, but if you flex your finger, you may notice the tendon pulling away from the bone, creating the “bowstring” effect.  If you notice bowstringing, that’s the only test you need, you’re done. You don’t need to do any other tests, you just need to call your doctor's office and get an appointment. You likely completely tore your A2 and A3 pulleys. They will need to do testing and possibly imaging to determine the extent of the damage and plan your course of treatment.

OK so you did all of your tests. Here is a way to categorize your results. Now, just know, that not all injuries will fit perfectly into this box, it is simply a guide to help better understand your injury.

Treatment

The treatments we are going to discuss are designed to optimize your body's ability to heal. They will assist with the collagen synthesis as the cellular matrix remodels, restore normal function with everyday activities, and will trigger adaptation to the stresses we plan to place on the tissue with climbing. Your body will only heal to the level that meets the demands you are asking it to do, such as with your activities of daily living. So the long term recovery for climbing will require high forces to be placed on the tissue, which we will introduce as retraining. Finally, we will talk about surgery and its implications.

Initially, your treatment will just involve healthy range of motion. If you cannot perform the full range of motion of the injured finger, you don’t need exercise or perform heavy tissue mobilization techniques, etc. You need to help protect the injury. Once you can go through a good range of motion without issue, you will work on tendon gliding. Tendon gliding can and should be performed on healthy tissue as well so even when you feel you are fully recovered, this is still a good strategy to continue with.

Soft tissue mobilization is mobilizing your tissue to promote remodeling through reorganization of the cellular matrix. This is appropriate even in the early stages of a pulley strain or partial tear but not with a full rupture. The advanced stage of this is with instrument assisted soft tissue mobilization which will be helpful as you leave the acute stage and enter the subacute and chronic phases of your healing.
