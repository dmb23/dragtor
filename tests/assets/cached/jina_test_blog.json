It’s what allows us to hold onto those tiny edges without the other parts of our finger essentially just coming apart. But how? It’s just a piece of tissue holding another tissue in place. And why is tearing your A2 the most ubiquitous injury in climbing?\n\nIn this mega video/manual we’re going to go in-depth into the A2 pulley. We will talk about anatomy, the causes of a tear and how to test yourself for it, the things you can do to treat it as well as ways of preventing it from happening in the first place and in the future, and the thing everyone wants to know: how soon can you get back to climbing.\n\nTo fully understand this injury and how we can heal from it we need to get our bearings, anatomically speaking. So to start off we’re going to take a look at our fingers and how they actually work, which in turn will make the testing and treatments sections make a lot more sense.\n\nTreatment\n\nThere are going to be multiple components of your treatment that you can do to help in the short and long term. Some of them you can continue throughout your healing process, and even when the injury is fully recovered just to promote healthy strong tendons. In the show notes we have organized all of the treatment aspects that we are about to discuss into a table which will help you follow along based upon your injury.\n\nThe idea of this section is to give you an idea of what to do, and also what you can expect to do to help treat this injury. But, it is always best to seek out professional help if you think you have a partial or complete tear. It’s great to have more information from someone who is experienced dealing with these injuries to help guide you on your way.\n\nThe treatments we are going to discuss are designed to optimize your body's ability to heal. They will assist with the collagen synthesis as the cellular matrix remodels, restore normal function with everyday activities, and will trigger adaptation to the stresses we plan to place on the tissue with climbing. Your body will only heal to the level that meets the demands you are asking it to do, such as with your activities of daily living. So the long term recovery for climbing will require high forces to be placed on the tissue, which we will introduce as retraining. Finally, we will talk about surgery and its implications.","title":"a2-pulley-manual-for-climbers","id":"jina_test_blog","author":"Test McAuthor","metadata":{"source":"test_blog","source_type":"blog","blog_name":"Test Blog","author":"Test McAuthor"}}
