A lot of people have injuries and niggles and things that they're confused about and I think we got a lot of great questions that I think will lead into hopefully kind of more global helpful takeaways for how to prevent these injuries, how to deal with things like lumbricle injuries or cinnavitis or capsulitis or hypermobile fingers and how you train if you have super mobile fingers and then like injury prevention for fingers and how to promote finger health for all of us for aging climbers, etc so yeah, I'm really looking forward to it but as a way to kick things off, tell me a little bit about your background.
